/**
 * It is sometimes necessary to run Jacob without being able to install the dll
 * on the client machine. This is true in JavaWebStart (JWS) and possibly Applet
 * (assuming security allows access to the file system). The obvious thing to do
 * here is to jar up the Jacob.dll so that it can be downloaded the client along
 * with the rest of the resources. This is simple except that the System.Load()
 * function does not search jar files for DLLs. It searches the classpath. The
 * work around to this problem is to write the DLL to a temporary file and then
 * explicitly load the DLL calling passing the full path to the temporary file.
 *
 * The following code demonstrates this idea.
